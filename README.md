# Preparing Data
Download the augmented BSDS and PASCAL VOC datasets from:

http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/HED-BSDS.tar.gz

http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/PASCAL.tar.gz

Download the augmented NYUD dataset from:

http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/NYUD.tar.gz

# Pretrained Model
``checkpoint.pth‚Äù in this repository is our pre-trained model.

# Training
change the data path in ``main.py" to your own path, then run:

`python main.py`

# Testing
change the data path and checkpoint path in ``test.py" to your own path, then run:

`python test.py`

# Evaluation
The matlab code for evaluation can be downloaded in https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html. Before evaluation, the non-maximum suppression should be done through running ``edge_nms.m" in https://github.com/yun-liu/RCF.
